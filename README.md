# Building a Secure Network: Our First Team Project

This project is close to our hearts because it marks one of our earliest ventures into crafting a secure and reliable network infrastructure for a real-world environment. The goal? To design a network that doesn’t just "work" but truly shines in terms of security, scalability, and ease of management. It’s simple at a glance, yet sophisticated under the hood—a balance we’re proud to have achieved.

## Project Highlights

1. **Intuitive Yet Powerful Design**: We opted for a hierarchical tree structure rather than a basic star topology, allowing us to integrate multiple VLANs. This keeps departments neatly segmented and traffic flowing smoothly, all while ensuring every corner of the network is protected.

2. **Security All the Way**: Security was non-negotiable. From VLANs that isolate departments to firewall rules and daily rotating passwords for admin access, we thought carefully about every layer of protection. We even included an Azure backup server for a secure cloud-based safety net.

3. **Protocol Choices That Matter**: We weren’t just ticking boxes here. Every protocol—from HSRP for redundancy to OSPF for routing—was chosen to add stability and reliability. EtherChannel, for instance, combines links for extra bandwidth, making sure no department has to wait in line.

4. **Scalability with Ease**: We wanted this network to grow effortlessly as the company expands. By using VLANs and other flexible design choices, adding new departments or devices won’t require starting from scratch—just a few tweaks, and they’re part of the system.

## Final Touches

- **Rotating Password Scheme**: For admin access, we set up a daily rotating password protocol—a detail we loved implementing, knowing it added an extra layer of defense.
- **Personalized Access Controls**: Not everyone needs full access, so we tailored access controls for admins and users. It’s about giving just the right amount of privilege where needed, keeping the rest of the network safe.

Reflecting on this project, we see the results as more than just functional tech. It’s a collective achievement—a secure, efficient network shaped by our teamwork, attention to detail, and a little creative flair. Here’s to many more projects like this one!
